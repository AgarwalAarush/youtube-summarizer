There are few theories in physics with the 
potential to rewrite reality quite like string   theory. A theory so monumental in scope and 
ambition, it aims to accomplish the seemingly   impossible task of providing a singular model to 
explain the laws of the universe at all scales.   But, regardless of its scope and its growing 
fame, the scientific community has never agreed   upon its validity. And, for the watching world, 
it can still feel a little difficult to fathom.   So, this is Unveiled, and today we’re 
answering the extraordinary question;   what is string theory, and 
how exactly does it work?  Do you need the big questions answered? Are you 
constantly curious? Then why not subscribe to   Unveiled for more clips like this one? And ring 
the bell for more thought-provoking content! To over simplify it somewhat - string theory 
attempts to describe all particles in the universe   as infinitesimally small and vibrating strings. 
These strings are then one-dimensional objects,   and are hypothesized to be the most fundamental 
objects in the universe. If it’s correct,   then everything you are, know, see, even 
think, is the product of these strings.   Over a century ago, in 1915, Albert Einstein 
presented his newly formulated Field Equations to   the Prussian Academy of Science. These equations 
provided a beautiful description of how matter   interacts with each other via the force of 
gravity. They went above and beyond the work   carried out by Isaac Newton a few centuries prior, 
and explained gravity at the largest scales in   the universe, alongside predicting other phenomena 
such as time dilation and black holes. Since then,   the model has been proven in multiple ways, 
and is considered one of the most important   theories in physics. Unfortunately, however, 
as great as it is, it isn’t complete. General   Relativity - easily one of the most influential 
contributions to science - still doesn’t provide   an explanation for how gravity interacts on 
the scale of particles, in the quantum limit.    Surprisingly, the force of gravity is the 
weakest of the four fundamental forces,   which is perhaps not what you’d expect given 
that gravity literally moves planets. But,   this means that on the smallest scales of all 
(atomic and subatomic) gravitational interactions   are incredibly difficult to detect. All of the 
four fundamental forces have (or should have) a   respective particle that’s responsible for their 
effect… for example the photon, which mediates   the electromagnetic force. Gravity is then 
predicted to have its own mediating particle,   called the graviton. But, and again due to that 
comparative weakness of the gravitational force,   actually detecting the graviton is 
very, very hard to do. So hard, in fact,   that currently the graviton remains theoretical, 
only… and is thought to be impossible to observe.    And here’s where we get to string theory. In 
the 1960s, string theory began formulation   as an attempt to explain how what’s known as 
the strong nuclear force behaves, which is the   force responsible for holding hadronic particles 
like protons and neutrons together. The theory   proceeded to develop further in the 1970s, though, 
eventually attempting to describe all known   particles in the Standard Model. It was then in 
1974 that the Japanese physicist, Tamiaki Yoneya,   realized that all forms of string theory 
predicted a massless particle, too. What was   doubly exciting, however, was that this massless 
particle behaved exactly as was predicted for the   hypothetical graviton. This was monumental, as 
no theory had naturally provided an explanation   for the graviton before… and still no other 
theory has since. It was soon after this that   the separate theory of Quantum Chromodynamics took 
over from string theory as the leading explanation   of hadrons, specifically. However, by now string 
theory seemingly had bigger fish to fry in   physics… its main purpose shifted, and it became 
considered as the major contender for explaining   gravity on a quantum scale. As, potentially, the 
major contender toward a theory of everything.   So that’s the story behind it but, still, 
how does string theory actually work? Again,   it predicts every particle in the 
Standard Model, at their most fundamental,   to be vibrating strings - which are 
assumed to be a Planck length in size;   i.e., the shortest measurable distance. 
These strings are one-dimensional objects,   and the frequency of their quantum vibrations 
is what determines what type of particle   the string represents. From a mathematical 
perspective, the theory is pretty incredible,   providing many advancements which have now been 
applied to numerous other fields of science. On   the other hand, from a physical perspective, 
string theory has historically proven to be   a bit of a nightmare. During the 1980s, there 
were five separate string theories formulated,   with one particular version of those requiring 
a mind blowing 26 dimensions of reality to   work. But, eventually, in 1995, Professor Edward 
Witten proposed a new version called M-Theory,   which unified all five of the previous theories 
into one, and predicted only 11 dimensions in   total - ten spatial and one time. Meanwhile, 
there is another string theory - superstring   theory - that manages to work with only 9 spatial 
dimensions predicted, and one time; ten in total.   Broadly, though, what’s clear is that 
all types of string theory require extra,   unobservable dimensions. So what (or where) 
are these other dimensions? They’re generally   predicted to be compact; incredibly 
small and curled up. But, unfortunately,   as yet no one has been able to consistently 
explain the geometry of any of them,   and so there are essentially infinite ways that 
these extra dimensions could be described. And,   somewhat despairingly, it seems that the more 
research that’s been put into figuring them out,   the further string theory has strayed from 
working. On top of this, there’s no clear   way to physically test for the presence of 
string theory’s extra dimensions, either. So,   without any mathematical validity or physical 
observability, the quest has reached a bit of   a dead end… arguably (and perhaps substantially) 
damaging string theory’s reputation and momentum.    Today, many scientists then consider string 
theory to be a premature effort to solve the   problem of quantising gravity. General relativity 
was considered to be an almost fully formulated   theory within just years of its proposal. On 
the other hand, Quantum Field Theory, the theory   that explains how the fundamental particles of 
the universe behave, was nowhere near as fully   developed and formulated until the latter half 
of the century. String theory might’ve been like   quantum field, then… but, the difference is that 
in the decades since they first turned up, quantum   field theory has made significant progress, while 
string theory has floundered and become dormant.    There are direct links to be made, too. The main 
principle of quantum field theory is to describe   all particles as fields, as opposed to them being 
concentrated point charges. A simplification of   this concept would be to imagine all particles 
as clouds, as opposed to smooth balls. Probably   the most important offshoot here, however, is 
something called an Effective Field Theory.   Among other things, this is an intuitive method 
of making particle calculations, without knowing   the complete specifics of the physical phenomena 
they’re describing. Effective fields are then free   from mathematical restrictions, which in the days 
of Einstein made quantising gravity impossible. In   the past decade, there has been significant 
progress on formalizing general relativity   as an effective field theory. To finally 
explain how gravity works at a quantum scale.   So, what does this mean for string theory? 
Its past is complex and its future is a   little muddled. String theory hasn’t 
ever really been one singular theory,   and there has never been general agreement 
on which one is best. What’s more,   many of the researchers who pioneered string 
models now currently work in adjacent fields,   and are trying to look at quantum gravity from 
other perspectives. Tools that work within the   framework of string theory are still powerful, 
however. For example, calculations on how   gravitons scatter off each other have been done 
using entirely string-based methods. Regardless   of string theory’s seeming failure at producing 
a singular formal theory of everything, then,   its achievements and advances in mathematics 
should not go unnoticed or unpraised. To this   day it still remains the only theory to naturally 
predict a graviton, after all… as opposed to the   plethora of rival theories, such as Loop Quantum 
Gravity, which have never achieved the same feat.    In modern day physics, string theory doesn’t 
have the same momentum as it used to,   but its impact has still been significant. Beauty 
can still be seen within it, as it predicts even   the highest powers of the universe to be, at 
their base, simplistic, fundamental strings.   As for the future, there’s a chance we may 
someday find a new version of the theory,   free from the problems of prior attempts. Research 
today in the field is minimal, but there are still   dedicated teams devoted to making progress. 
It could yet be that we simply don’t have   the required mathematical tools at the moment… 
but, with time, we might develop them. For some,   there’s also the chance that string theory 
will one day solve (or contribute to solving)   some of the other big questions in physics, 
like uncovering the mystery of dark matter.   What do you think will happen? Do 
you think that, at its vibrating,   stringy core, this model could still prove to be 
the answer to everything? Or is there another,   entirely new theory just around the 
corner, one we are yet to even conceive? What do you think? Is there anything we missed?
