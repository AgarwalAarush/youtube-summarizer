what are the fundamental 
constituents that make up our world   what is all the matter in the universe made 
of what theory provides a description of the   physical properties of nature at 
the scale of subatomic particles what theory best describes everything 
can there be a Theory of Everything   American theoretical physicist Michio Kaku is 
the author of several books about physics and   has worked on research on quantum mechanics he has 
a unique way of explaining things that make hard   Concepts such as quantum physics and string 
theory seem apprehensible to us mere mortals   what I do for a living is string theory that's my 
day job and you see string theory is a Multiverse   Theory so people say first of all what is string 
theory String Theory simply says that all the   particles we see in nature the electron the 
proton the quarks what have you another thing   with vibrations on a musical string on a tiny tiny 
little string you know gee Robert Oppenheimer the   creator of the atomic bomb was so frustrated in 
the 1950s with all these subatomic particles being   created in our atom Smashers that he announced he 
announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics   should go to the physicist who does not discover 
a new particle that year well today we think that   nothing but musical notes on these tiny little 
vibrating strings so what is physics physics is   the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings 
what is chemistry chemistry is The Melodies you   can play on these strings what is the universe the 
universe is a symphony of strings things this is   the Mysterious World of quantum physics as we 
explore the strange and fascinating phenomena   of the subatomic world where particles behave 
in ways that defy our everyday understanding   of reality we will oversimplify these Concepts 
and hopefully you will forgive us for doing so   because there is nothing harder to understand in 
science than quantum physics as Richard fireman   once said if you think you understand quantum 
mechanics you don't understand quantum mechanics   at the heart of the quantum World lies the atom 
the building blocks of matter that were once   thought to be indivisible but as physicists delve 
deeper into the atomic World they discovered that   particles don't behave like the everyday objects 
we encounter in the quantum World particles exist   in a cloud of probability they can be in two 
places at once and have a mysterious connection   that Einstein called spooky action at a distance 
to make things even more bizarre particles seem to   be influenced by The Observer as if they are aware 
of being watched but that's not all String Theory   takes us even deeper into the Mysterious World 
of subatomic particles according to this Theory   particles are not tiny dots but tiny strings 
that vibrate at different frequencies creating   the variety of particles that make up our universe 
it's fascinating to think that thousands of years   ago ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus 
attempted to understand the atomic World using   reason and logic you know Pythagoras was a rival 
of democracies democracies talked about Adams   2000 years ago and Pythagoras said no no music 
is the language of the universe so you look at   a liar string and said look at the vibrations 
each vibration corresponds to a musical note   the universe is music the universe is created by 
vibrating things each vibration corresponds to a   note he went to a blacksmith where there were long 
bars of metal and they were clanging These Bars of   metal he realized that the longer the metal the 
lower the note there's a relationship between the   length of the object its strength and the note 
and then he looked at a liar string and he said   the longer the liar string the lower the note and 
then he said this is the universe what explains   the diversity what Paradigm is Rich enough to 
explain the diversity of the entire universe   atoms but what makes atoms different and then he 
said it's music but then they never went anywhere   because of course the atomic theory wasn't created 
for another 2000 years but finally with the atomic   theory we now have subatomic particles but why 
do we have so many subatomic particles they're   nothing but musical notes on a tiny tiny little 
vibrating string so this is the electron vibrates   this way this is a quark this is a neutrino so why 
do we have so many particles in the particle Zoo   the nothing but vibrations on a tiny string string 
theory has also led to some intriguing ideas such   as the possibility of a Multiverse where our 
universe is just one of many while this idea   is purely theoretical it shows that the quest to 
understand the subatomic world is far from over   some of the greatest Minds in science have 
struggled to understand quantum theory   one of the most notable was Albert Einstein 
who believed in a hidden reality that we   can't directly observe he rejected the idea of 
entanglement but as experiments continued to prove   the validity of quantum theory Einstein's views 
became increasingly marginalized when I was eight   something happened to me as well it was in all the 
papers that a great scientist had just died and   they put a picture of his desk on the front page 
that's it just a simple picture of the front page   of the newspapers of his desk that desk had a book 
on it which was opened and the caption said more   or less this is the unfinished manuscript from 
the greatest scientists of our time so I said to   myself well why couldn't he finish it what's 
so hard that you can't finish it if you're a   great scientist it's a homework problem right 
why couldn't he solve it so to me this was a   murder mystery this was greater than any adventure 
story I had to know why the greatest scientists   of our time couldn't finish something and then 
over the years I found out the guy had a name   Albert Einstein and that book was the theory of 
everything it was unfinished well today I can read   that book I can see all the dead ends and false 
starts that he made and I began to realize that   he lost his way because he didn't have a physical 
picture to guide him on the third try on the first   try he talked about clocks and lightning bolts and 
meter sticks and that gave us special relativity   which gave us the atomic bomb the second great 
picture was gravity with balls rolling on curved   surfaces and that gave us the Big Bang creation 
of the universe black holes on the third try he   missed it he had no picture at all to guide him 
well today we think that picture is string theory   String Theory also proposes the existence of extra 
Dimensions beyond the three we are familiar with   it's a mind-bending concept that raises the 
possibility of multiple universes each with   their own set of physical laws these parallel 
universes also known as the Multiverse are a   popular Topic in science fiction but they are 
also a serious area of study for scientists   the idea is that every time there is a 
decision to be made the universe splits   off in two or more possible outcomes each 
occurring within its own separate universe   String Theory could also help explain the mystery 
of Dark Matter this mysterious substance makes   up around 27 percent of the universe but we 
can't directly observe it one explanation is   that dark matter is made up of particles known 
as wimps weakly interacting massive particles   which could be produced by the vibrations 
of strings while there is still so much we   don't know about String Theory it is opened up 
new avenues of research and shown us that the   universe is far more complex and wondrous than we 
ever imagined however String Theory ought to be   more accurate the string hypothesis has also been 
heavily criticized by the scientific community   one of the main criticisms is that it is difficult 
to test or falsify it the theory requires the   existence of extra Dimensions beyond the three 
we are familiar with but these dimensions are too   small to be observed directly another criticism 
is that the theory is yet to make any predictions   that can be verified through experiments despite 
Decades of research and numerous mathematical   developments string theory has not produced any 
definitive results that can be tested in the lab   some scientists argue that the theory is overly 
complex and convoluted requiring the existence   of multiple universes and exotic particles that 
have yet to be observed while string theory has   the potential to revolutionize our understanding 
of the universe it is important to approach it   with a critical eye and to continue to explore 
alternative explanations for the mysteries of   the subatomic world I would say that any 
field of research when it's new yeah it's   going to track attention and the news outlets are 
going to cover it and students are going to flock   to it sure but as a field matures it does shed 
those qualities because it's no longer as novel   as it was when it was first introduced 30 or 40 
years ago but you need to judge it by a different   standard you need to judge it by is it making 
progress on foundational issues deepening our   understanding of the subject and by that measure 
string theory is scoring in very high now at the   same time you also need to judge whether it 
makes contact with experiment two and in that   measure we're still challenged so I would say 
that many string theorists myself included are   very sober about the theory it has the tremendous 
progress that it had 30 40 years ago that hasn't   gone away but we've become better equipped 
at assessing the long journey ahead [Music]
